# Afame-Technologies
# Overview:
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset consists of 150 samples, each containing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to build a machine learning model to classify the flowers accurately. The project includes data exploration, model building, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

# Skills Learned:
• Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Learned how to clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and prepare it for training a machine learning model.

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gained experience in visualizing the dataset, understanding feature distributions, and detecting patterns that could help improve model performance.

• Feature Engineering: Identified and worked with relevant features for classification (sepal and petal measurements).

• Machine Learning: Developed classification models using algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), evaluated them using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

• Data Visualization: Used libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions, model performance, and relationships between the features and the target variable.

# Tools Used:
• Python

• Pandas

• Scikit-learn

• Matplotlib/Seaborn

• Jupyter Notebook

# Deliverables:
• Iris Species Classification Model: A machine learning model (using K-Nearest Neighbors) that classifies Iris flowers based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

• Confusion Matrix & Classification Report: A set of performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix visualizing the model's predictions.

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A detailed EDA showing the distributions of features, pairwise relationships, and the correlation between features.

• Model Evaluation: A performance evaluation of the classification model with different metrics to understand its efficiency and effectiveness.

• Visualizations: Several charts and graphs visualizing feature distributions, the relationships between features, and model evaluation metrics.

# Methodologies:
• Data Exploration: The dataset is explored to understand the distributions of features, correlations between them, and the overall structure of the data.

• Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned (if needed), and features are selected for the classification task.

• Model Training & Evaluation: We use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a simple yet effective classification algorithm. The model is trained and evaluated on the dataset, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess its performance.

• Model Evaluation: The model's predictions are evaluated using a confusion matrix, and a detailed classification report is generated.

# Steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Extract Data:  Load the Iris dataset (sepal and petal lengths, sepal and petal widths, and the species).

Clean Data: The dataset is relatively clean, but any missing values are handled (if applicable), and text labels are converted into numeric form (for machine learning algorithms).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Feature Distributions: Histograms are plotted to examine the distributions of sepal and petal measurements.

Pairwise Relationships: A pairplot is used to visualize relationships between features.

Correlation Matrix: A correlation heatmap helps to visualize relationships between features, which might help in improving model performance.

Model Training:

Train Model: We use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a supervised learning algorithm, to classify the species of the Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Evaluate Model: The model is tested using unseen test data, and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

Model Evaluation:

Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is plotted to evaluate the classification accuracy and the model's ability to distinguish between different species.

Classification Report: A detailed classification report summarizes key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each Iris species.

Visualization:

Histograms & Boxplots: To visualize the feature distributions.

Pairplot: To show relationships between features and how well they separate species.

Confusion Matrix Heatmap: To visualize the model's performance in terms of true and false positives/negatives.

Report Writing:
Model Performance: Summarize the evaluation results, including performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
